# Welcome to buddy !!

This is a React JS web app.
It is deployed on

 1. [Render](https://t1m-react-b3.onrender.com/)
 2. [Netlify](https://t1m-react-b3.netlify.app)

## Steps to follow for development on Local

You need backend running on your local. To do that follow these steps

 1. Clone [backend repo](https://github.com/gani-paircode/address-book)
 2. Install all dependencies - `npm i`
 3. Start the server `npm run start`
 
 This should run the development backend server on the port `5000`
 Confirm it by running the curl command on local. Find more details [here](https://github.com/gani-paircode/address-book#readme).
 
 Now it's time to setup frontend.
 
 1. Clone this repo 
 2. Install all dependencies run `npm i`
 3. Start the server - `npm run start`
 4. During development, your backend api's base url will be `http://localhost:5000`. At the time of deployment it will be required to change.
